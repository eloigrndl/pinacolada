      <article role="main" class="blog-post">
        <p align="justify">John is a young data scientist who thoroughly enjoys the Applied Data Analysis course. He also has another passion in life - Youtube. He wants to start his own adventure and turn his passion into a living. Before embarking on his journey, John wishes to conduct an analysis of YouTube in order to identify patterns of evolution and gain a better understanding of the platform.</p>

<h2 id="available-data">Available Data</h2>

<p align="justify">John has at his disposal the Youniverse dataset, which is divided into several subsets : among others, a Youtube channels dataset and another focusing on the time series of these channels.</p>

<p align="justify">First, let's look at the categories of these channels.</p>

<iframe src="/pinacolada/assets/plots/exploration/cat_pie_chart.html" height="620" width="820" frameBorder="0"></iframe>

<p align="justify">Throughout time, some categories have gained prominence and taken up a large portion of the landscape, like Music, Entertainment, and Gaming.</p>
<p align="justify">This can be explained by the fact that these genres are far more inclusive than others (Music vs Pets &amp; Animals), in terms of their target audience.</p>
<p align="justify">Another explanation is that the channels in these major categories don't always belong to the typical independent Youtube creators but rather to businesses or actors that are a part of a broader sector. Take music, where T-Series, a significant Indian record label, has the most followers (more than 100 millions).</p>

<h2 id="audience">Audience</h2>

<p align="justify">Moreover, how much does each category generate audience ?</p>

<p align="justify">As indicated by the previous pie chart, a few categories, namely Entertainment, Gaming, Music, and News Politics, largely monopolize the majority of the audience in our sample, both in terms of subscribers and published videos.</p>

<iframe src="/pinacolada/assets/plots/exploration/category_statistics.html" height="1020" width="820" frameBorder="0"></iframe>

<p align="justify">However, when we combine these two units, the big picture appears to shift: we can see that other categories have the highest ratio of subscribers to videos produced. This time, the categories are Comedy, Film and Animation, and Howto &amp; Style. This could be due to increased user loyalty, as users prefer to follow funny content creators rather than news channels (shown by the very low ratio of News &amp; Politics).</p>

<p align="justify">To get a better understanding, let's a deeper look at the metadata of those categories. When we examine the interactions between users and creators (particularly through likes and dislikes), we can draw the same conclusions as before: certain categories (Entertainment, Gaming, and Music) appear to monopolize the interactions.</p>

<iframe src="/pinacolada/assets/plots/exploration/categories_participation.html" height="520" width="1100" frameBorder="0"></iframe>

<p align="justify">However, when these figures are normalized to the number of videos in each category, the ranking shifts again, and other categories generate a high number of interactions per video. This reinforces the above-mentioned trend of user preferences and loyalty, particularly in the Comedy category, which has the highest ratio yet again. However, the three categories mentioned above (Entertainment, Gaming, and Music) generate a high number of interactions per video and are ranked second, fourth, and seventh, respectively.</p>

<iframe src="/pinacolada/assets/plots/exploration/categories_participation_ratio.html" height="520" width="1100" frameBorder="0"></iframe>

<iframe src="/pinacolada/assets/plots/exploration/categories_ratio.html" height="520" width="1100" frameBorder="0"></iframe>

<p align="justify">To conclude this point about interaction, by linking dislikes and likes, we see that the most represented categories do not appear to be those that are universally supported by users:
Entertainment has a very low like/dislike ratio when compared to Shows, which has a very high like/dislike ratio when compared to the other categories.</p>
<p align="justify">The following two categories are Comedy, which has a high engagement rate, and Gaming, which is one of the most represented categories in terms of channel count.</p>

<h2 id="duration">Duration</h2>

<iframe src="/pinacolada/assets/plots/exploration/categories_duration.html" height="520" width="950" frameBorder="0"></iframe>

<p align="justify">When looking at the average and median lengths of the videos, there are a few outliers within the categories: shows, gaming, education, and non-profit, which are all around 1000 seconds or longer, while the majority of the other categories are between 200 and 600 seconds.</p>

<p align="justify">Choosing a short video category, such as Howto &amp; Style, may benefit John because it may take him less time and energy to create than a longer video.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p align="justify">To summarize, we can see from this quick data analysis that certain categories are overrepresented, but that quantity is not synonymous with quality: these same categories are not always those that arouse the commitment of their audience.</p>

<p align="justify">This helped John, our data scientist, decide which field to start in: he needs a category that addresses a large audience while allowing you to build a community.
HowTo &amp; Style could be an appropriate field: while being in the top subscribers category, it still piques the audience's interest as it has high likes/dislikes ratios over the numbers of videos.</p>
